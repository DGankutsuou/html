		<h1>Nameless monster</h1>
		<!-- Paragraphs are to not put everything in one line -->
			<h2>Chapter 1:</h2>
				<p><i>
					Long ago, in a distant land, a <strong>monster</strong> was dying to have a name. <br>
					However, the world was so large that the <strong>monster</strong> split in two. <br>
					One <strong>monster</strong> went West, and another <strong>monster</strong> went East. <br>
					The <strong>monster</strong> that went East happened upon a little town. <br>
					At the town's entrance, he met a blacksmith. <br>
				</i></p>
			<h2>Chapter 2:</h2>
				<p><i>
					The <strong>monster</strong> asked the blacksmith for his name, but the blacksmith replied that he couldn't give him his name. <br>
					The <strong>monster</strong> then convinces him that if he let him enter into his body, he would make him stronger. <br>
					The blacksmith obliges, and and the <strong>monster</strong> enters into him. <br>
					The <strong>monster</strong> then became known as <b>Otto</b> the Blacksmith. <br>
					Because of the <strong>monster</strong>'s influence, <b>Otto</b> became the strongest person in the village. <br>
					However, one day, the Blacksmith was telling everyone that the <strong>monster</strong> inside of him was getting bigger, and the <strong>monster</strong> bursts out of him and eats his remains. <br>
				</i></p>
			<h2>Chapter 3:</h2>
				<p><i>
					Still a <strong>monster</strong> without a name, the <strong>monster</strong> then went to see Hans the Shoemaker, and like last time, he eats him from the inside out. <br>
					He then entered into <b>Thomas</b> the Hunter, but the outcome was exactly the same as before. <br>
					He then went to a fine-looking kingdom and went to the sickly prince while he was in bed. <br>
					Like before, he convinces the boy to let him enter into him, and he'll make him well. <br>
					The <strong>monster</strong> kept his word, and the boy is healed. <br>
					The king was overjoyed that his son was finally well, and the <strong>monster</strong> decided to stay in the boy's body, because he liked the boy's name and the luxury that came with living in a castle. <br>
				</i></p>
			<h2>Chapter 4:</h2>
				<p><i>
					However, the <strong>monster</strong>'s hunger grew more and more stronger each day, until eventually, the <strong>monster</strong> inside him just couldn't take it any more. <br>
					He ate the king and all of his servants. <br>
					Eventually, the <strong>monster</strong> consumed everyone and everything in the village. <br>
					He then happens upon the <strong>monster</strong> that went west, and he tells him that he had finally gotten a name. <br>
					The <strong>monster</strong> from the West replied that he didn't need a name, and liked being a nameless <strong>monster</strong>. <br>
					The boy then eats the <strong>monster</strong> that came from the West. <br>
					The <strong>monster</strong> was overjoyed that he finally had a name, but realized that no one was around anymore to call him by that name, which was a shame, because <strong>Johan Liebert</strong> was such a wonderful name. <br>
